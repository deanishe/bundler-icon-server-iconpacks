# Bundler Icon Server Icon Packs #

These are webfonts and accompanying files pre-packaged for the [Bundler Icon Server](https://github.com/deanishe/bundler-icon-server).

An archive contains the following files:

```
fonts/
	fontname.json
iconserver/

		css/
			fontname.css
iconserver/
	static/
		fonts/
			fontname.eot
			fontname.svg
			fontname.ttf

```
